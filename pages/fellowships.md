# Fellowships

## Fellowship workshop

Every fall semester we hold a fellowship workshop with first-years, as many fellowships are only available to first-years or are easier to get as a first-year. The workshop is primarily focused on applying for NSF GRFP. Students who have received fellowships lead the workshop. Weâ€™ll help you find fellowships that you qualify for, professors to talk to about recommendations, and edit your essays.

## Fellowships

The national fellowship which students most commonly apply to is the [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (NSF GRFP)](https://www.nsfgrfp.org). It is a good 3-year fellowship and students in our department have a pretty solid history of getting it. If you are eligible for NSF GRFP, putting in a good application should probably be your top priority in your first semester. If anything, faculty know how useful it is for you to get it, so it'll be a good way to start talking with them about research.

People also apply to:

- [National Defense Science and Engineering Fellowship (NDSEG)](https://ndseg.sysplus.com/)
- [DOE Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF)](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/)
- [NASA Space Technology Graduate Research Opportunities (NSTGRO)](https://www.nasa.gov/nasa-space-technology-graduate-research-opportunities-nstgro/)
- [Hertz Fellowship](https://www.hertzfoundation.org/the-fellowship/)

### Fellowships specific to our department.

The department has relationships with private companies to fund fellowships. They are typically a shorter duration (1 year or 1 semester), and you have to apply to them through the department. Currently Two Sigma and Citadel offer fellowships. See more details on [the department's website](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/research/industry).

### Other fellowships

Many private companies (think tech companies, hedge funds) offer fellowships which you can apply for. Berkeley also has a [very long list of fellowships](https://grad.berkeley.edu/financial/options-for-financial-support/fellowships/) specific to the school. Very rarely you may receive a fellowship you did not apply for.
