# Union

Students at Berkeley who work as a GSR (researcher) or GSI (teaching assistant or instructor) are  all represented by the same union, [UAW 4811](https://www.uaw4811.org). Postdocs are also represented by UAW 4811. The union is the body which negotiates with the university to decide our wages, other benefits, and protections.

Here are some union pages with more information:

- The [wage tables](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gKYgyyv17M01ZabYofWBreJhI9POP55hPGSQeHIAV5E/edit?usp=drive_link) which describe pay at different levels for GSIs and GSRs.
- The [grievance process](https://www.uaw4811.org/handle-a-grievance). Some students in the department have been through this process.
- [Information for international students](https://www.uaw4811.org/international-scholars).

Students can choose to be a member of the union or not. Membership status does not affect a student's contract. Being a member means:

- Being able to vote in union elections.
- Paying "dues": when you hold a GSR or GSI appointment, a part of your wages (1.44%) goes to the union. Dues partly fund the local union (UAW 4811) and partly go to the overarching union (UAW). (Dues are automatically deducted from pay for union members)
